https://qcoreprotocol.org/

Qcore is a scalable yield farming protocol built on QTUM blockchain.With the rise of Defi projects like yearn, Uniswap and Sushi etc, we see a strong demand and market future for QTUM Defi projects. We build our contract in a scalable way for adopting any QRC20 tokens with different decimal settings, including future QRC20 LP tokens.

QCore protocol v1 is completed and deployed on QTUM testnet. You need to use [remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to compile the contracts to get ABI, then use QTUM Desktop wallet to interact with QCore to farm QCORE Token.
We have detailed guides to walk through contract interaction

Contracts are open source, and pre-compiled abi and bytecode are available in deployment folder for quick start on smart contract interaction
